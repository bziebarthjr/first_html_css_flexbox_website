            <h1>My Path to Business Analysis</h1><br><p>
            <p>My career starts in the late 1990s. My first job out of high school was selling cell phones with Mid-America Wireless in Missouri.</p><br><p>This is where I made it to Senior Wireless Consultation and received my first professional awards. I was top salesman of the quarter for 6 quarters running, salesman of the year, and received top producer awards from Southwestern Bell Wireless.</p><br><p>This section does not go through all the positions that I have done. It does list the roles that I have held throughout my working life.</p>

            <h1>First Steps Into Information Technology</h1><br><p>Information Technology was always a love of mine. My entry into programming was learning on the family 486 PC using QBasic.</p><br><p>I made a rudimentary game that asked the player to solve math problems. As each problem was answered the math problem was shot and then you moved to the next portion of space.</p><br><p>I also learned to work on personal computers during this time. I bought a couple used computers and learned to work on them by moving parts between them and upgrading them.</p>

            <h1>9/11 Changed Everything</h1><br>
            <p>My plan was to pursue a career in IT. However, September 11, 2001 changed many things in our country. My career path was one of them.</p><br><p>The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services started the Center for Emergency Response and Terrorism. Their goal was to prepare the State of Missouri for Emergency Events. I took a position as Duty Officer with them.</p><br><p>My role was to monitor events in the state such as open bed in hospital ERs, bio-monitors across the state that watched for biological weapons, and monitoring news channels and reports for reports pointing to potential incidents.</p><br> ​
            <p>​It was during this time that my IT roots again became needed. There was no system for documenting events in the Department Situation Room and actions taken. I taught myself Relational Databases and Microsoft Access so I could build a system that would allow this documentation.</p><br><p>The final system not only documented the results but reminded users when pre-scheduled monitoring was needed, took entered data and filled out forms, then connected to a software fax machine and faxed reports where they needed to go.</p>

      <div class="box1"><h1>Joining Task Force 1</h1><br>
            <p>It was also during this time that I was introduced to Missouri Task Force 1. This is a FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Team.</p><br><p>I joined the Team as a Technical Information Specialist. The duties were to monitor and document activities taken during rescue events. Our team also trained all positions as Rescue Specialists.</p><br><p>I went on three deployments with this team in Louisiana, Texas, and Minnesota. On one deployment I served as the Planning Team Manager due to the manager coming down sick. This led me to becoming a firefighter with both Cole County and Boone County Missouri and a Hazardous Materials Technician.</p>

      <div class="box1"><h1>Becoming an Instructor</h1><br>
            <p>Instructing is another love of mine. It was during this time that I became an instructor for Incident Command System, CPR, First Aid, and an Instructor Trainer for three American Red Cross Chapters.</p><br><p>I also taught Community Mass Care as an Adjunct Instructor for the University of Missouri Fire and Rescue Training Institute. This allowed me to teach across the state of Missouri.</p>

      <div class="box1"><h1>Business Process Manager</h1><br>
            <p>I started at Wipro as a Medicare Claims Specialist. It was not long before my background and skills changed that trajectory.</p><br><p>A client was having issues on-site. They needed an experienced manager to go in and turn the project around. I was promoted to BPO Manager and sent to the client.</p><br><p>Within one week, we not only turned the results around but became the highest performing of three on-site contract companies and gained a contract extension. I also was assigned additional teams and asked to be Project Manager on a software implementation for a Medicaid Appeals System.</p>

            <p>Supervised a team of up to one hundred people in Part D Pre-authorizations, Appeals, and Medicaid Member Services.</p><br><p>Created and taught course for New Hires in completing Part D Prior Authorizations.</p><br><p>Created algorithm that utilized attendance, call quality, NPS scores, audits, schedule adherence, and call time to credit a score that managers utilized for performance appraisals and promotions.</p> 
            <br><p>It was during these activities that I was introduced to the world of Data Science and Business Analysis. Personal issues (not related at all to work) caused me to need to move back to Missouri from Nashville.</p><br><p>It was at this time that I decided to go back to school and pursue a career change into Business or Data Analysis.</p>
